By providing a naturally occurring means of protecting inhabitants from dangerous levels of radiation and undesirables; lava tubes also offer future explorers a way to greatly reduce the time, resources and effort needed to initially construct safe and practical habitat and other pressurized support facilities such as greenhouses and maintenance enclosures. Another advantage of this approach is that it reduces the amount of construction materials required to be placed in orbit and then relocated on a lunar and/or martian surface. \n\nCurrently, 4th Planet Logistics’ objective is an evaluation of the practicality of pressurizing terrestrial lava tubes directly by creating atmospheric barriers that utilize the lava tube’s naturally occurring regime as a primary or secondary structural shell. This approach will involve the use of 3D printable, locally derived, geological materials and complementary robotic assembly techniques.",

      "Providing commercial transportation and propellant depots from Low Earth Orbit to the Moon’s surface and all points in between",
    about:
      "Cislunar Space Development Company is a Space transportation and logistics provider. We move satellites, cargo and people from low Earth orbit to the Moon’s surface and all points in between.  And, of course, we bring the people back to low Earth orbit from the Moon.\n\nOur initial Space tugs pick up satellites launched into a 180 km altitude orbit and deliver them to geosynchronous transfer or geosynchronous equatorial orbit.  The geosynchronous transfer orbit Space tug may use an aerobrake on its return to low Earth orbit to minimize propellant requirements.   An aerobrake is definitely included on our geosynchronous equatorial orbit Space tug.  These initial Space tugs deliver up to 3000 kg to geosynchronous transfer or equatorial orbit.  In-orbit refueling from Earth launched tankers provides propellant for each new mission.\n\nThese initial Space tugs can also relocate satellites, deorbit large orbital debris objects, provide initial boost to interplanetary missions and serve the Adventure Travel industry.\n\nOnce our Space tug capabilities are proven, we add propellant depots in low Earth orbit and Earth Moon Lagrange Point 1.  The propellant depots receive water from Earth. They produce and store liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and provide in-orbit refueling to our Space tugs and Moon shuttle.  Space tugs and Moon shuttle are docked at propellant depots between missions.\n\nA larger version of our Space tug is used to service customers going to the Moon.  It is sized to carry 25,000 kilograms from low Earth orbit to the Earth Moon Lagrange Point 1, where gravity forces between the Earth and Moon are balanced.  Payloads for this Space tug include Earth Moon Lagrange Point propellant depot assemblies, water, lunar surface hardware, and personnel modules.\n\nOur Moon shuttle is based at Earth Moon Lagrange Point 1 propellant depot.  It is sized to land 25,000 kg on the Moon and return without refueling.  By designing our larger Space tug and Moon shuttle to handle 25,000 kg we are able to deliver Bigelow Aerospace’s B-330 from low Earth orbit to the Moon.  The Moon shuttle also carries our personnel module on a round trip between Lagrange Point 1 and the Moon’s surface.\n\nOur target market base includes satellite operators, interplanetary scientists, Adventure Travel companies, sovereign Space agencies, Moon explorers and Moon developers.\n\nPlease contact us to learn more.",
